> “Archetype (formerly DigiPal) lets us search, annotate, and teach with the same manuscripts that inspired the project’s earliest blogs and conference papers. The reboot keeps that spirit alive with state-of-the-art tooling.”

## Why a reboot?

- DigiPal has supported landmark research topics such as [digital dating models](https://www.digipal.eu/blog/the-problem-of-digital-dating-dh2015-paper/) and [codicological sequence modelling](https://www.digipal.eu/blog/modelling-codicology-i-sequence-in-gatherings-folios-and-pages/).
- The original Django monolith served scholars for over a decade, but new projects now expect composable APIs, IIIF-native viewers, and realtime editorial workflows.
- Archetype keeps the proven methodology while rebuilding the app as independent services (Django REST API, React/Next.js frontend, Docker-first infrastructure, and a GitHub Pages knowledge base).
